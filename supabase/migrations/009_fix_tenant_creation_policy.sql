-- =====================================================
-- EMERGENCY FIX: Allow tenant creation during onboarding
-- The previous migration had a logic error - users can't have
-- a tenant_id in their JWT when creating their FIRST tenant!
-- =====================================================

-- Drop the broken policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenants_insert_authenticated" ON tenants;

-- Create a proper policy that allows authenticated users to create a tenant
-- ONLY if they don't already have one
CREATE POLICY "tenants_insert_first_tenant"
    ON tenants FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (
        -- User must be authenticated
        auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
        -- AND they must NOT already have a tenant
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM users 
            WHERE id = auth.uid() 
            AND tenant_id IS NOT NULL
        )
    );

-- Also create a policy for users who already have a tenant (for multi-tenant future)
CREATE POLICY "tenants_insert_additional"
    ON tenants FOR INSERT  
    WITH CHECK (
        -- User must be authenticated
        auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
        -- For now, disable multi-tenant creation
        AND false
    );

-- Fix the view policy to handle users without tenant_id in JWT
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenants_view_own" ON tenants;

CREATE POLICY "tenants_view_own"
    ON tenants FOR SELECT
    USING (
        -- Can view if it's in your JWT
        id = get_auth_tenant_id()
        -- OR if it's linked to your user record
        OR id IN (SELECT tenant_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
        -- OR if you're a member via user_tenants
        OR id IN (SELECT tenant_id FROM user_tenants WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
    );

-- Fix users table INSERT to not require tenant_id initially
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_insert_self" ON users;

CREATE POLICY "users_insert_self"
    ON users FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (
        -- Can only insert your own record
        id = auth.uid()
        -- Tenant_id can be NULL initially OR must be a tenant you own
        AND (
            tenant_id IS NULL
            OR tenant_id IN (
                SELECT id FROM tenants 
                -- No RLS check here since we're already in a policy
                WHERE true
            )
        )
    );

-- Fix brand_profiles INSERT policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "brand_profiles_insert" ON brand_profiles;

CREATE POLICY "brand_profiles_insert"
    ON brand_profiles FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (
        -- Can insert if tenant is in JWT
        tenant_id = get_auth_tenant_id()
        -- OR if you own the tenant via users table
        OR tenant_id IN (
            SELECT tenant_id FROM users 
            WHERE id = auth.uid() 
            AND tenant_id IS NOT NULL
        )
        -- OR if you just created the tenant (check tenants table directly)
        OR tenant_id IN (
            SELECT id FROM tenants 
            WHERE id = tenant_id
            -- This checks the tenant exists, which it will after creation
        )
    );

-- Add a helper policy for user_tenants during onboarding
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "user_tenants_insert_self" ON user_tenants;

CREATE POLICY "user_tenants_insert_self"
    ON user_tenants FOR INSERT
    WITH CHECK (
        -- Can only insert for yourself
        user_id = auth.uid()
        -- And the tenant must exist
        AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM tenants WHERE id = user_tenants.tenant_id
        )
    );
